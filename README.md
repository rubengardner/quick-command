# Quick-Command

**Your personal URL-launching shortcut engine**

Quick-Command is a sleek browser extension that lets you save your most-used URLs as quick-access commands. Think: GitHub, docs, dashboards‚Äîopen them instantly via keyboard or command palette, saving you clicks and time.

##  Why I Built This

 As a backend engineer constantly switching between dashboards, documentation, and tools, I wanted a way to open my go-to pages **without context switching**‚Äîno clicking bookmarks, no typing URLs. Inspiration struck: why not treat URLs like commands?  
 This led to the creation of Quick-Command‚Äîa tool that organizes your workflow into a lightning-fast, keyboard-driven experience.

##  Key Features

- Save any URL as a named command (e.g., `gh`, `jira`, `dashboard`)
- Trigger commands quickly via defined keyboard shortcuts or a popup command palette
- Lightweight‚Äîminimal dependencies, fast loading
- Built with modern extension APIs and easy to customize

##  How It Works

1. **Manifest**: Defines browser permissions, command configurations, and UI entry points (`manifest.json`)
2. **Command Manager**: Lets users assign names and URLs to commands
3. **Popup UI**: Type a command name to open its URL (autocomplete-enabled)
4. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Launch the command palette with one keystroke, then type and hit `Enter`
5. **Storage**: Uses browser `storage.sync` (or `storage.local`) to remember your defined commands across sessions

 ## How It Looks & Feels ‚Äî Sleek, Minimal, and Fast

Quick-Command isn‚Äôt just functional ‚Äî it‚Äôs designed to feel smooth, modern, and enjoyable to use.  
Every interaction is supported by subtle animations that make command execution feel instant and satisfying.

Adding a new command is effortless ‚Äî give it a name, paste the URL, and it‚Äôs ready to use in seconds.

‚ú® **Bonus:** Quick-Command includes smooth animations for menu transitions and feedback, so using it feels as good as it looks.

##  Example Use Cases

| Command | URL                          | Use Case                           |
|---------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|

##  Why It Stands Out

- **Improves developer flow**‚Äîno more tab clutter or hunting through bookmarks.
- **Customization first**‚Äîyou define commands that match *your* work style.
- **Easy to share**‚Äîinclude your command definitions in your dotfiles or team toolkits.

##  Future Enhancements

- Command aliases & lookup fuzzy search
- Categorization or tagging of commands
- Cross-browser support (Firefox, Edge, etc.)
